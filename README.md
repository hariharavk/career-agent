CareerAgent is an open-source, multi-LLM platform engineered to automate your job search while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and professional formatting. 

It finds jobs via custom Playwright scrapers (job boards, company pages), extracts competencies using AI, perfectly aligns your qualifications with the job description, and compiles professionally formatted LaTeX PDFs designed to be accurately parsed by corporate Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Job Discovery**: Scrapes job boards and company career pages in real-time to instantly find roles that match your exact profile and preferences.
- **AI Match Scoring**: Instantly evaluates your profile against the job description, providing a definitive match score to help you prioritize your best opportunities.
- **Dynamic Resumes & Cover Letters**: Automatically aligns your qualifications with the JD to compile professionally formatted LaTeX resumes and cover letters for flawless ATS parsing.
- **Flexible AI Engine**: Fully agnostic architecture. Route via OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini—or run 100% locally and privately with Ollama. The choice is yours.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Python (3.11+)
- API Keys (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) or local Ollama running.

### 1. Start the Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend (React + Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to access the CareerAgent dashboard.

## 📸 Demo Mode
